To Do
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands 

    mysql> source db/schema.sql; => Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.03 sec) Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
THEN a development database is created... 
mysql> show databases; <=== is it there??
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| books_db           |
| database_db        |
| demo_db            |
| ecommerce_db       |<==== yup! There it is!

...and is seeded with test data
rhyssmoker@Rhyss-MacBook-Air E-Commerce-Back-End % npm run seed 

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
